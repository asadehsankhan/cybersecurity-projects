# Cybersecurity-Projects
This repository contains my hands-on cybersecurity projects where I practice both attacking and defending systems.
As an aspiring purple teamer, I work on finding security weaknesses (red team) and then fixing and protecting them (blue team).

These projects include work from the Google Cybersecurity course, CompTIA Security+, and my own labs.
They show how I test systems for vulnerabilities, secure Linux and networks, and apply real-world security techniques to keep data and systems safe.
